Downloading the Source
-----------------------

:math:`\texttt{HODLR3Dlib}` is distributed using the git version control system, and is hosted on Github. The repository can be cloned using::

    git clone https://github.com/SAFRAN-LAB/HODLR3D.git --recursive

The ``--recursive`` flag is an argument to ensure that all submodules are also checked out.

Dependencies
-------------

- Eigen Linear Algebra Library (get it `here <https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page>`_)
- (optional) An OpenMP enabled compiler (e.g. gcc4.2 or above) is required to use shared-memory parallelism.

**NOTE**: On MacOS, the default compiler is `clang` which doesn't have OpenMP support. You will have to use g++ to make use of the speedups from OpenMP::

    user@computer HODLR3D$ brew install g++-10
    user@computer HODLR3D$ export CXX=g++

Installation
-------------

Then, set the environment variable ``EIGEN_PATH`` to the location of your Eigen installation.::

    user@computer HODLR3D$ export EIGEN_PATH=path/to/eigen/

Testing
-------

Key in the ``testHODLR3D.cpp`` to be used as input under ``SOURCES`` in ``HODLR3D/Makefile.mk``. Here you also set the name of the output executable under ``EXECUTABLE``. Then perform a make clean to remove all the previously generated executables run the ``Makefile``. Further, to get your executable run the make file. Finally run the executable with the necessary run-time inputs::

    user@computer HODLR3D$ make -f Makefile.mk clean
    user@computer HODLR3D$ make -f Makefile.mk
    user@computer HODLR3D$ ./testHODLR3D

Building and Executing
----------------------

Key in the required ``.cpp`` to be used as input under ``SOURCES`` in ``HODLR3Dlib/Makefile.mk``. Here you also set the name of the output executable under ``EXECUTABLE``. Then perform a make clean to remove all the previously generated executables run the ``Makefile``. Further, to get your executable run the make file. Finally run the executable with the necessary run-time inputs::

    user@computer HODLR3D$ make -f Makefile.mk clean
    user@computer HODLR3D$ make -f Makefile.mk
    user@computer HODLR3D$ ./executable
