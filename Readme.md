HODLR3Dlib introduces a new class of hierarchical matrices for N-body problems in 3D. It performs matrix vector product in almost linear complexity. The domain is subdivided using a uniform tree. Low rank approximation of the appropriate submatrices has been obtained using Adaptive Cross Approximation. The code has been parallelised using MPI.
